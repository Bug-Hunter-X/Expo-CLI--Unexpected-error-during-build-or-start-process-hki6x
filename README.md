# Expo CLI: Unexpected Error During Build or Start

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo CLI: an unexpected error during the build or start process.  The error often stems from version mismatches or corrupted cache files. This example showcases the error and provides solutions.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to start the Expo project using `expo start`.
3. Observe the unexpected error message in the console.

## Solution

1. **Check `package.json`:** Verify that the Expo CLI version listed in the `dependencies` section of your `package.json` file matches the installed version.
2. **Clear the Expo cache:** Use the command `expo prebuild --clean` to clear the Expo cache.
3. **Reinstall dependencies:** Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to reinstall all project dependencies, ensuring they are compatible with your Expo CLI version.
4. **Update Expo CLI:** Use `npm install -g expo-cli@latest` (or `yarn global add expo-cli@latest`) to update Expo CLI to the latest version. 
5. If the issue persists, consider creating a new Expo project to rule out potential issues specific to the current project configuration.
